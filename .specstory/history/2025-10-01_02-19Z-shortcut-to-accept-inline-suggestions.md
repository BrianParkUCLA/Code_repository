Based on your question about shortcut keys to accept inline suggestions, I can provide you with the common shortcuts for accepting suggestions in code editors. Since you're using Cursor (as evidenced by the `.cursorignore` file in your project), here are the standard shortcuts:

## Common Shortcuts for Accepting Inline Suggestions:

**Tab** - This is the most common and universal shortcut to accept the currently highlighted inline suggestion/autocomplete.

**Enter** - In many editors, pressing Enter will also accept the current suggestion.

**Right Arrow Key (→)** - Sometimes used to accept word-by-word suggestions.

## For Cursor specifically:

Since you're using Cursor, the default shortcuts are typically:
- **Tab** - Accept the current suggestion
- **Ctrl+→** (Windows) or **Cmd+→** (Mac) - Accept word by word
- **Escape** - Dismiss the suggestion

## To customize shortcuts in Cursor:

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to **File → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts** (or **Ctrl+K Ctrl+S**)
3. Search for "accept" or "suggestion" to find the relevant commands
4. Modify the keybindings as needed

The most universally accepted shortcut across all code editors is **Tab** to accept inline suggestions and autocomplete.
